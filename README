Codeiary
--------

Mission: To create a single place to find information on algorithms, functions,  recipes in different programming languages. Discuss them and their proper useage. Advantages and disadvantages in a given context.


Ramblings On:
The idea behind Codeiary is to have a place to post and discuss, code snippets. You could look for Python bubblesort algorithms. You could look for bubblesort algorithms of any language. You can attach your own private labels. You can present your benchmarking or various versions of sorting algorithms. Code can be changed but references must be able to reference specific versions. Doesn't make sense to say, "this code as a bug" unless the bug is still there. Author or Tester or user with enough Karma, can remove such messages, when necessary.
